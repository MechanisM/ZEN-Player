[Latest Demo](http://lab.simurai.com/ui/zen-player/)

Current state: It works more or less in Firefox4, Chrome, Safari, Opera, but there are some differences in the visuals. Other known issues are:

- There is no preload indicator yet.
- Chrome on Windows has a known bug where the circles don't get cut off, no panic, should already be fixed in the nightly.
- Opera starts to rotate funky after the first round, no idea why.
- It needs a proper fallback for older browsers. A Modernizr and Flash combo should do it.
- Plus, no mobile support yet.

PS: Thanks to a friendly worm named [@maboa](http://twitter.com/maboa) who created the original version and most of the JS code.
